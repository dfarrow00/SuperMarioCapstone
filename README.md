# Super Mario Bros C++ Remake Capstone Project

Welcome to the repository for my university capstone project - a remake of Super Mario Bros in C++ using the SFML library!

This project aims to recreate the classic Super Mario Bros NES game in C++ using the SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) framework. Every effort has been made to capture the essence of the original game, ensuring an authentic gameplay experience along with enhanced graphics and quality of life additions.
