Improvements:
- Tweak physics to be more efficient and accurate to original
- More detailed collision detection (Indicate which side of mario AABB is colliding)
- Use a tile map instead of individual tile images for each tile.

Features to add next:
- Jumping (Most likely needs more detailed collision detection first)
- More Tiles

Fixes
- deltaTime must be being calulated incorrectly somehow. Jumping only works when FPS is limited to 60. But using
deltatime, the jump should be framerate independent and not affected by this change.
