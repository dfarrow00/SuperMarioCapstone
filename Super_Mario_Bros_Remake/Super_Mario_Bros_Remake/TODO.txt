Improvements:
- Tweak physics to be more efficient and accurate to original
- Use goomba side detection method from GameState.cpp for ? blocks
- Rearrange includes (#include in cpp and forward declare in header)
- Changing HUD score to be updated when score changes may be more efficient that updating every frame.
- Possibly change where stats are stored (e.g. lives in mario class instead of gamestate) and how they are updated in HUD.

Features to add next:
- More Tiles
- Prevent movement past left side of the screen.

Changelog:
- Stats such as score, lives, timer etc.
- Fully functional HUD.
- Fixed mario goomba bounce velocity to be consistent
