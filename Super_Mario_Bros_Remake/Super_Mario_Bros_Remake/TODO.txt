Improvements:
- Tweak physics to be more efficient and accurate to original
- Use goomba side detection method from GameState.cpp for ? blocks
- Rearrange includes (#include in cpp and forward declare in header)
- Possibly change where stats are stored (e.g. lives in mario class instead of gamestate) and how they are updated in HUD.

Features to add next:
- More Tiles
- Prevent movement past left side of the screen.

Known Bugs:
- Mario in big state can go through blocks with side collision at a certain height. May need to add
middle left and middle right collision checks when mario is big.

Changelog:
- Added flashing effect when mario is hit is big state
- Fixed goombas colliding with other goombas that are inactive
- Added remaining mushroom ? blocks to map.
